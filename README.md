# Javsino-Java-Personal-Project [In Progress]
A personal project, a text based casino simulation built in the Java language.


My notes and how I thought out the logic and steps it would take to build this program:

# Structure of Program

Opens on welcome text that introduces the name and aim of the game, the player is asked to input the max amount of money in their wallet that they will be betting with. They are then introduced to the 5 potential games and told to select one. After one is selected they are walked over to the table and a prompt appears asking them if they would like a tutorial of the game or want to freeplay. After the tutorial is complete they are asked to place their bet/pot which may differ depending on which game they have chosen to play. If they win over 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0 of their money an encouraging statement will accompany each percentage win. If they lose the same percentage of their original bets a warning statement will accompany each transaction. Once the round of the came is over a prompt will ask them if they would like to play another round/edit their bets or leave the game and cashout. Their new balance will be printed once they leave that game, they will then be given the option to leave the javasino or continue playing another game. If they bust out of money they will be removed from the javasino and the javasino experience will end. However if they win over 1000% of their money back they will also be comically removed from the javasino in a private helicopter to the Jotel suite that the javasino people have put on for them to enjoy (theyâ€™re just winning too much).

# Classes and methods needed

1. **Game Functionality Classes:**
    - Classes responsible for managing the game logic, actions, and state. These classes focus on the underlying mechanics of the game.
    
    ```python
    
    class Player:
        # Player-related functionality
    
    class Room:
        # Room-related functionality
    
    class Game:
        # Main game loop and logic
    
    ```
    

1. **User Interface (UI) Classes:**
    - Classes responsible for displaying information to the user and handling user input. This includes text prompts, messages, and menus.
    
    ```python

        @staticmethod
        def display_intro():
            print("Welcome to the Adventure Game!")
    
        @staticmethod
        def display_room_description(room):
            print(f"You are in {room.name}. {room.description}")
    
        # More methods for displaying different types of text
    
    class UserInput:
        @staticmethod
        def get_choice(options):
            # Get and validate user input for choices
    
    ```
    
2. **Main Game Class:**
    - The main game class that orchestrates the interaction between the game functionality and user interface classes.
    
    ```python
    
    class AdventureGame:
        def __init__(self):
            self.game_text = GameText()
            self.user_input = UserInput()
            self.game = Game()
    
        def start_game(self):
            self.game_text.display_intro()
            # Continue with the game loop, room transitions, etc.
    
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        adventure_game = AdventureGame()
        adventure_game.start_game()

# Identify the different games and features.

# Roulette

1. **Straight Bet (Single Number):**
    - Payout: 35 to 1
    - If someone places a $100 bet on a single number and wins, they would receive $3,500 (including their original $100 bet).
2. **Even-Money Bets (e.g., Red/Black, Odd/Even):**
    - Payout: 1 to 1
    - If someone places a $100 bet on an even-money option and wins, they would receive $200 (including their original $100 bet).
3. **Dozens or Columns:**
    - Payout: 2 to 1
    - If someone places a $100 bet on a dozen or column and wins, they would receive $300 (including their original $100 bet).
    
    # Blackjack
    
    1. **Winning a Regular Hand (Not a Blackjack):**
        - If a player wins a regular hand (i.e., their hand beats the dealer's hand without being a blackjack), the payout is usually 1 to 1. This means that if a player bets $100 and wins, they would receive $200 in total, including their original $100 bet.
    2. **Winning with a Blackjack (Natural 21):**
        - If a player is dealt a blackjack (an Ace and a 10-value card) and the dealer does not also have a blackjack, the payout is typically 3 to 2. In this case, if a player bets $100 and wins with a blackjack, they would receive $150 (1.5 times their original bet) in addition to their original $100 bet.
        
        # Baccarat
        
        1. **Player Bet:**
            - If a player places a $100 bet on the Player hand and wins, the payout is typically 1 to 1. This means that they would receive $200 in total, including their original $100 bet.
        2. **Banker Bet:**
            - If a player places a $100 bet on the Banker hand and wins, the payout is also typically 1 to 1. However, a commission is usually charged on Banker wins (commonly 5%). As a result, the player would receive $195 (original $100 bet plus $95 in winnings after the 5% commission).
        3. **Tie Bet:**
            - If a player places a $100 bet on a Tie and wins, the payout is higher and is typically 8 to 1 or 9 to 1, depending on the casino. If the payout is 8 to 1, the player would receive $900 in total, including their original $100 bet.
            
            # Slots
            
            Slots depend on the type of combo that has been rolled.

                - 1 Star (wild) in a winning combination: Doubles the win
                - 2 Stars (wilds) in a winning combination: Quadruples the win
                - 3 or more Stars (wilds) in a winning combination: 10% return per additional wild
